## Git workshop

This repository was set up for a Git workshop for CodeHub Bristol in October 2016 and then modified for another workshop in February 2017. It is based on the idea from the [OpenTechSchool Git workshop](http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/) to add Cafes and Pubs to a directory. You can see the resulting website here: https://codehuborg.github.io/gitworkshop/
