## Git workshop

This repository was set up for a Git workshop for CodeHub Bristol in October 2016 and then modified for another workshop in February 2017. It is based on the idea from the [OpenTechSchool Git workshop](http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/) to add Cafes and Pubs to a directory. You can see the resulting website here: https://codehuborg.github.io/gitworkshop/

Here are the [exercises](docs/workshop/README.md) for the February 2017 workshop.

And these are some slides illustrating some of the concepts: https://slides.com/katjadurrani/git-2017/live#/
